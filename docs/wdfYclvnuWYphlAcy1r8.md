<div align="center">    <br/>    <div>DOC</div>    <h1>different visual states of the app</h1>    <br/>  </div>

<br/>

In our app, there are a lot of different states that a `unit` / `playlist` / `doc` can be at.

Each state has a different UI look like and we should test it in our flows

    *   local md
        
    *   not found md
        
    *   random internet link
        

What the testing workspace contains?
====================================

*   2 plans (empty and filled with resources)
    
    *   the filled plan contains also all of the resources previously described in the repo section.
        

Where is it
===========

1.  In the staging environment. That means you'll need a running version of `swimmStaging` or `yarn:dev`
    
2.  under a workspace named `_flows` . If you're not there - ask the team to invite you.
    
3.  It contains a repo named `book of flows(dev)` which is on the branch `dev_flows` of `squirrelly-with-units` so go ahead and swimm install it, just don't forget to checkout the correct branch!
    

What we need to add (// TODO)
=============================

1.  exercises states
    
2.  public repos states
    
3.  resources for watching them in edit mode (without saving!)
    
4.  more autosynced examples / the examples from the actual repo of `squirrelly-with-units`
