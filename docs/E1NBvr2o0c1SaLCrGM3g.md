These steps should be taken when issuing a hotfix.

Checkout from the current RELEASE.
==================================

For that, go to `master` branch, and checkout the current stable release.

For example: `git checkout v0.4.1-0`.

Create a branch to introduce the hotfix
=======================================

From the "stable" (yet buggy) release's branch, create a new branch, for example: `git checkout -b v0.3.6-1-branch`

It's important **not** to use the name you will later use for the tag (e.g., `v0.3.6-1`).

Create another branch where you'll actually implement the hotfix
================================================================

For example: `git checkout -b hotfix-dealing_with_EOF`

Make the changes
----------------

Fix the bugs, debug, push, issue a PR to the generic hotfix branch (in this example, `v0.3.6-1-branch`).

Release
=======

After merging the PR, issue a release according to the release routine.

Merge to develop?
=================

If desired, issue a PR introducing the changes of the hotfix - to `develop`.

**Post Hotfix Deploy**
======================

Add a comment about the hotfix to the upcoming Retro. Discuss with the team how (and if) we can avoid it
